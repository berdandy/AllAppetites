# All Appetites Welcome

## Overview

Everybody has more games they want to play than they reasonably have time for. For some people it’s just a problem of not enough hours in the day; for others, it’s not having the players who are interested in committing to a longer game that might span multiple play sessions. All Appetites Welcome is a concept designed to match the needs of individual players with specific game products, without judgment.

(In talking about tabletop roleplaying games we usually draw a distinction between the Players and the Game Master or person running the game. For the purposes of this concept, everyone who participates in the game is a player, no matter which side of the table or screen they’re on.)

## The Bite

Imagine you’re demoing this game to your friends and you want to quickly show them the cool parts

* Suggested price: Free
* Enough content to play through a short (~15-minute?) scenario
* No prep required

Say you want to try out The Burning Wheel, but you only have fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes is not enough time to go through all of The Burning Wheel’s rules and mechanics, but it might be enough time to go through one or two scenarios, to give you a feel for what the game is like. The Bite is designed to satisfy player curiosity, to demonstrate what the game’s mechanics are like without exposing the player to all of the game’s more complicated rules.

## The Bowl

Imagine you have a group that wants to play but can’t commit to a campaign and don’t have time to plan something ahead of time, and you don’t want to spend a ton of time making characters

* Suggested price: ~USD$10-20
* Enough content to play through a full first session
* Premade Characters, Premade Scenario, Lightly Scripted
* Minimal prep required (choosing characters, picking a scenario)

The Bowl is meant for players who want to play the game, but don’t have time for or aren’t interested in building a longer campaign that will require scheduling or tracking of character sheets. Sometimes you just want to kill a dragon, and that’s okay. The Bowl gives you everything you need to Play the Game, without the need to spend time beforehand crafting characters, filling out character sheets or playbooks, or designing dungeons. Everything is ready for you out of the box. People with a lot of experience with board games might be most comfortable with the Bowl.

## The Buffet

Imagine you want to absorb the game’s entire rule set and use it to run a full-fledged campaign

* Suggested price: ~USD$20+
* Enough content to learn and master the entire game, build a character or a campaign, play forever
* Rules for building characters and scenarios
* Comprehensive setting information
* Variable Prep (making characters from scratch, guiding players and GM through the process of play, including advancement rules)

The Buffet, then, is for people who love roleplaying games and specifically love this roleplaying, and who want to play a longer campaign with the same characters, who want to dive deep into the rules and master every aspect of the world and its mechanics.

## Pricing

Each of these tiers is catered to a specific type of player. Because the Buffet requires more preparation and energy, but also offers greater potential for entertainment in perpetuity, we price the Buffet at a higher level than the Bowl, which is meant for a single experience, even if players might want to repeat that experience again. Imagine wanting to watch the same movie again, and that’s the appeal of the Bowl. The Bite, because it’s meant to be a small sample of the game, because it’s not meant to be repeatable and requires no preparation whatsoever, is free to all players.

## Final Notes

It’s very important to remember that each of these parts in the All Appetites model is equally valuable. What this means is that as a designer and publisher, you should take the same care with your Bite as you would with your Buffet. Your Bite is what you’ll take with you to the convention floor, to meetings with publishers, to your local game shop. Your Bowl is what you’ll take with you to parties for an impromptu gaming session. You might feel the strongest personal connection to your Buffet, but don’t neglect the other tiers of your three-tiered cake.
